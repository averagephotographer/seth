AGENDA
Wake the kids and get breakfast at the hotel restaurant
Get an Uber to Disney (make sure to bring changing clothes)
Go on some rides then eat
WAIT BEFORE GETTING ON MORE RIDES (for the sake of mine and the kids stomachs)
Get on some more rides
Make sure to schedule the uber home ahead of time
Probably change then take the uber back to the hotel
Get dinner from taco bell if the kids are hungry
Teach Jag his alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
TAKE PICTURES AT EVERY RIDE (Marg wrote this)
